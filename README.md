Avalanche - Design – Narrative Design - Permanent Employment - Hybrid

Hey!

I've included two writing samples. One is an excerpt from a feature length screenplay called "Wandering". This script has received funding from both SF Studios and The Swedish Film Institute. It is currently in development by Björn Carlström and Per Janérus
at Harmonica Films (producers of the "Jägarna" films and tv-series).

The other writing sample is in the form of images from an imagined RPG adventure in the style of EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. It's called "GATES OF VEXNA" and all writing and design is by me. Some of the images have been created by Midjourney but most are
from free internet sources. Throughout the years I've created several of these imagined games as a hobby - this is one of them!

That's it, that's all - thanks for considering my application!
