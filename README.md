Avalanche - Design – Narrative Design - Permanent Employment - Hybrid

Hey!

I've included two things here. One writing sample in the form of an excerpt from a feature length screenplay called Wandering. This script has received funding from both SF Studios and The Swedish Film Institute. It is currently in development by Björn Carlström
at Harminica Films (producers of the Jägarna films and tv-series and more).

The other writing sample is in the form of images from an imagined point and click adventure in the style of EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. It's called GATES OF VEXNA and all writing and design is by me. Some of the images have been created by Midjourney but most are
from free internet sources. 

That's it, that's all - thanks for considering my application!
